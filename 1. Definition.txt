SQL | DDL, DQL, DML, DCL and TCL Commands
---------------------------------

DDL - Data Definition Language
It provides the storage structure and methods to access data from the database system.

CREATE
ALTER
DROP

Use to create and drop databases, aliases, locations, indexes, tables and sequences,
Alter these objects and impose or drop certain constraints on tables.

Apart from the CREATE, DROP and ALTER commands, DDL includes other commands:
COMMENT ON is used to add a single-line, multiline or inline comment about an object in the catalog tables at the current location.
LABEL ON is used to add or change descriptive text labels describing tables, views, aliases or columns to the catalog tables.
RENAME is used to modify the name of a database table.
TRUNCATE is used to quickly remove all records from a table, while preserving its full structure so it can be reused later.

---------------------------------

DML - Data Manipulation Language
It enables users to manipulate (add/modify/delete) data.
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
LOCK: Table control concurrency.
CALL: Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram.

---------------------------------

DQL - Data Query Language
It enables users to retrieve required data from the database.
SELECT

---------------------------------

DCL – Data Control Language
It deals with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.
REVOKE: This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

---------------------------------

TCL – Transaction Control Language
Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit.
Each transaction begins with a specific task and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully complete.
If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure.

COMMIT: Commits a Transaction.
ROLLBACK: Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
SAVEPOINT:Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
SET TRANSACTION: Specify characteristics for the transaction.

A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. 
These are popularly known as ACID properties.
